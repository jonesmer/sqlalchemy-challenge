Using SQLAlchemy

This repository contains climate_starter.ipynb, which lays the groundwork for the Flask app, called app.py. It looks at a database and analyzes the weather data contained in it.

(side note: as of 4/15, this is incomplete - I can't get my .py file to run at all - I can't figure out why it won't read the sqlite file; the jupyter notebook runs it with no problems. I also need to figure out the dynamic pages. Sorry)
