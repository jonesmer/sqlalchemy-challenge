## Using SQLAlchemy

This repository contains **climate_starter.ipynb**, which lays the groundwork for the Flask app, called **app.py**. It looks at a database and analyzes the weather data contained in it.

app.py allows a user to see some of the data in JSON format - and in the case of two routes, the user can select a date range.

Some things I might improve in a future iteration of this project might be to expand the routes and make them all dynamic. I also might make the user input more flexible (right now it only accepts dates in one format, and that could be expanded to include dashes or different orders of year/month/day).

All code was written by me, with some help from google (only concepts, I wrote the actual code) and my classmates (again, only concepts and some debugging).
